# iPhoneCalcRIP-OFF
This is a rip off of the classical iPhone Calculator . This project has been made with PyQT5

## Pre-Installation Dependencies :
Before installing , run the following command in CMD : `pip install PyQt5`

## Installtion :
Download the file as zip , extract all its contents to the same folder , and run the file named `iphone.py`

## Features :
Yeah well , its a regular calculator . Nothing much different about it <br>
**PS : To close the calculator , type `close` in the calculator textbox and press the `=` button on the calculator**

## Limitations :
While making it as close to the iPhone Calculator possible , i had to use the eval() function , which has a history of not going down well with decimals . So , sometimes in decimal calculations , the answer will have a lot of trailing zeroes . In the future I will most likely switch to the`Decimal` Module to resolve  this problem . Till then , one can only cope :/
